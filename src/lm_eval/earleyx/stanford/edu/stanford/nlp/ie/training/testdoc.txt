SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 16 — Executives of Samsung Electronics forecast
today that the company's high-end products would guarantee another year
of robust earnings, shrugging off the sagging prices of memory chips 

Samsung, the global leader in memory chips, has stood alone in that
business, which has struggled with sinking prices. A 128-megabit dynamic
random access memory chip now costs more to make than the typical $2 it
fetches on world markets.
