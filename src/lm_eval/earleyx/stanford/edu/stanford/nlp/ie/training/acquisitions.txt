<sellerabr>HONEYWELL</sellerabr> {<sellercode>HON</sellercode>} COMPLETES COMPUTER BUSINESS SALE
    MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., March 27 - <seller>Honeywell Inc</seller> said it has

Bull</purchaser>} of France and {<purchaser>NEC Corp</purchaser>} of Japan for <dlramt>527 mln dlrs</dlramt> in
cash.
    <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> said it will use much of the money to reduce
short-term debt incurred last December when the company
purchased the Sperry Aerospace Group.
    <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> said the sale of <acqabr>HIS</acqabr> has created a new dedicated
computer company jointly owned by <purchabr>Bull</purchabr>, <purchabr>NEC</purchabr> and <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr>.
    The new privately held company, named Honeywell Bull, is
42.5 pct owned by <seller>Honeywell Inc</seller>, 42.5 pct by <purchabr>Bull</purchabr> and 15 pct by
<purchabr>NEC</purchabr>, the new company said.
    <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> added that terms of the agreement with <purchabr>NEC</purchabr> and
<purchabr>Bull</purchabr> allow it to reduce its current 42.5 pct stake in the new
company to 19.9 pct at the end of 1988 by selling just over
half its shares to <purchabr>Bull</purchabr>. Book value at the time will determine
the move's pricing, <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> said.
    <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> chairman and chief executive officer, Edson
Spencer, said the move is the last major step in Honeywell's
restructuring.
    "As the leading worldwide supplier of of automation and
controls for buildings, industry, aerospace and defense,
Honeywell is now focusing its management, technical and
financial resources on high market share business," Spencer
said.
    <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> said it expects to be Honeywell Bull's largest
customer, purchasing computers for its own internal data
processing, for integration into <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> buidling and
industrial automation systems and for resale to the U.S.
governement.
    <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> said <acqabr>HIS</acqabr>'s Federal Systems Division is now a
wholly owned unit of <seller>Honeywell Inc</seller>, and has been named
Honeywell Federal Systems Inc.
    <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> said it accounted for <acqabr>HIS</acqabr> as a discontinued
operation in 1986, and will account for its future interest on
a cost basis, recording any dividends as received.
    Honeywell Bull said it will continue to develop its product
line and build its business in integrated systems for
networking, database management and transaction processing.
    The new company said its board will have nine members,
including the chairman and chief executive officer.
    Bull will have four members, <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> two and <purchabr>NEC</purchabr> one, the
new company, which began worldwide operations today, said.
    It added that Jacques Stern, <purchabr>Bull</purchabr>'s chairman and chief

INVESTOR GROUP PUTS PRESSURE ON <acqabr>GENCORP</acqabr> {<acqcode>GY</acqcode>}
    By Patti Domm, Reuters
    NEW YORK, March 30 - An investor partnership, seeking to
acquire <acquired>GenCorp Inc</acquired>, said it would attempt to unseat the
company's board of directors and take other <status>hostile actions</status> if
the firm refuses to discuss its <dlramt>2.3 billion dlr</dlramt> takeover bid.
    <purchaser>General Acquisition Co</purchaser>, comprising investors Wagner and
Brown and glass-maker AFG Industries, also reiterated its
willingness to negotiate with <acqabr>Gencorp</acqabr>.
    The partnership has earlier offered 100 dlrs per share for
<acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr> -- a <acqbus>tire, broadcasting, plastics and aerospace</acqbus>
conglommerate.
    Analysts have speculated that <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr>, on a break-up basis,
could fetch more than 110 to 120 dlrs per share.
    <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr> officials had no comment on <purchabr>General Acquisition</purchabr>'s
statement but a spokesman reiterated an earlier request to
shareholders to wait until its board renders an opinion before
making a decision on the <purchabr>General Acquisition</purchabr> tender.
    <acqabr>Gencorp</acqabr> said its statement would be made on or before the
company's annual meeting, scheduled for Tuesday.
    <purchabr>General Acquisition</purchabr> made its statement in a letter sent to
the <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr> board on Friday.
    The partnership said it was willing to negotiate all points
of its offer, including price.
    The group the board cannot fully carry out its fiduciary
duties to <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr> shareholders and make a fully informed
decision about its offer until it has "thoroughly explored with
us the ways in which our offer can be revised to provide
greater value to your shareholders."
    <purchabr>General Acquisition</purchabr> said it is aware the board may be
reviewing alternative transactions which might provide <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr>
shareholders with a payment other than cash.
    "If that is the case, you should recognize that our
additional equity capital may very well enable us to offer cash
and securities having greater value than <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr> could provide
in any similarly structured transaction," the partnership said.
    <purchabr>General Acquisition</purchabr> also said it believes that <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr>'s
board has an obligation to present any alternative transaction
it may propose to shareholders in a manner that would allow for
competing offers.
    The partnership requested that if any other proposal is
under consideration that it be given the same information
available to <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr>'s managers and advisers in constructing a
proposal.
     <purchabr>General Acquisition</purchabr> said that if <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr> agrees to accept
another buyout proposal that it also be given an opportunity to
bid on a competitive and fair basis before any final decision
is made.
    <purchabr>General Acquisition</purchabr> repeated its request that <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr>
remove its "poison pill" or shareholders rights plan.
    <purchabr>General Acquisition</purchabr> said if <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr> does not allow an
"environment for fair competition," it will take all steps
necessary to create such an enviroment.
    It said it may take legal action or seek the support of
shareholders in calling a special meeting to replace the board
and to consider other proposals it might develop.
    <purchabr>General Acquisition</purchabr> also said if the board decides to
accept an alternate proposal it asked that it not accept a plan

ANALYSTS APPLAUD <sellerabr>CSR</sellerabr>'S BOLD MOVE TO SELL <acqabr>DELHI</acqabr>
    By Peter Bale, Reuters
    SYDNEY, March 31 - <seller>CSR Ltd</seller> {<sellercode>CSRA.S</sellercode>} has made a bold move in
selling its <acqbus>oil and gas interests</acqbus> for <dlramt>almost a billion dlrs</dlramt> and
ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share
analysts said.
    "It sounds like a good deal," Stuart McKibbin of {A.C. Goode
and Co} told Reuters.
    <sellerabr>CSR</sellerabr> said it had dropped plans to float its <acqbus>oil and gas
interests</acqbus> held in the {<acquired>Delhi Australia Fund</acquired>} and would instead
sell it to Exxon Corp {XON} unit {<purchaser>Esso Exploration and
Production Australia Inc</purchaser>} for <dlramt>985 mln dlrs</dlramt>.
    In a twin announcement <sellerabr>CSR</sellerabr>, already Australia's largest
sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it
does not already hold in {Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd}.
    "This will be a big shock to the market, which was under the
impression that <sellerabr>CSR</sellerabr> was well down the road to floating <acqabr>Delhi</acqabr>,"
McKibbin said.
    A float of part of <acqabr>Delhi</acqabr> would have raised between 200 and
300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, <sellerabr>CSR</sellerabr> had given
itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on
an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing
divisions of sugar and building products, analysts said.
    <sellerabr>CSR</sellerabr> not only gets the <dlramt>985 mln dlrs</dlramt> but also has the right
to share equally with <purchabr>Esso</purchabr> any higher returns resulting from an
oil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years.
    <acqabr>Delhi</acqabr> is one of <acqloc>Australia</acqloc>'s largest onshore oil producers
yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin.
Analysts said the deal could net <sellerabr>CSR</sellerabr> as much as three mln dlrs
for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs.
    Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker {Bain and Co Ltd}
said the move out of <acqabr>Delhi</acqabr> and investment in the sugar industry
was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of
Australian-owned assets to a foreign company.
    "The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold
back to the Americans," Goldston-Morris said.
    The Pioneer Sugar investment would make <sellerabr>CSR</sellerabr> by far the
largest player in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry
and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties
and mills in the country, analysts said.
    They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend
acceptance of the bid through which <sellerabr>CSR</sellerabr> would benefit from the
bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices.
    Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next
season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said.
    Selling <acqabr>Delhi</acqabr> meant <sellerabr>CSR</sellerabr> has finally quit a damaging
investment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company's
overall performance, analysts said.
    <sellerabr>CSR</sellerabr> last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on
what had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirely
from U.S. Dollar debt, they said.
    "It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirely
with debt, the currency collapsed on them and then the oil
price collapsed on them," Owen Evans of Sydney broker {Meares
and Philips Ltd} said.
    <purchabr>Esso</purchabr> not only picked up <acqabr>Delhi</acqabr>'s oil and gas output but also
gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses
accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions.
    Analysts said <purchabr>Esso</purchabr> also gained its first real onshore stake
in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50
Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd
{BRKN.S}.
    "<purchabr>Esso</purchabr> has been very keen to diversify from the Gippsland
Basin. They haven't found too much oil in Bass Strait lately
and <purchabr>Esso</purchabr> needed a large pool of ongoing production,"
Goldston-Morris said.

<purchabr>CSR</purchabr> BIDS 2.20 DLRS A SHARE FOR <acqabr>PIONEER SUGAR MILLS</acqabr>
    SYDNEY, March 31 - <purchaser>CSR Ltd</purchaser> {<purchcode>CSRA.S</purchcode>} said it will <status>offer</status> 2.20
dlrs cash each for the shares it does not already hold in
{<acquired>Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd</acquired>}.
    <purchabr>CSR</purchabr> already holds 31.74 pct of <acqabr>Pioneer</acqabr>'s 99.80 mln issued
shares, it said in a statement.
    The offer price values the entire <acqabr>Pioneer Sugar</acqabr> share
capital at 219.6 mln dlrs and compares with today's closing
market level of 1.85 dlrs a share.
    <purchabr>CSR</purchabr> said it will announce further details of the offer
soon, including an alternative offer of <purchabr>CSR</purchabr> shares for <acqabr>Pioneer
Sugar</acqabr> stock.
    It said the offer is generous since it will give <acqabr>Pioneer
Sugar</acqabr> shareholders a price equivalent to 29 times <acqabr>Pioneer</acqabr>'s net
earnings last financial year and a premium of 22 pct over
yesterday's market price which <purchabr>CSR</purchabr> said it believed already
contained an element of takeover speculation.
    It also gives a premium of 91 pct over <acqabr>Pioneer</acqabr>'s last
reported net tangible assets per share, <purchabr>CSR</purchabr> said.
    <purchabr>CSR</purchabr> said the generous offer price reflects the cost savings
which will flow from integrated management of <purchabr>CSR</purchabr>'s and
<acqabr>Pioneer</acqabr>'s <acqbus>raw sugar mills and building materials</acqbus> businesses.
    These economies can only be achieved through <purchabr>CSR</purchabr> control
and management of <acqabr>Pioneer Sugar</acqabr>, it added.
    The takeover announcement came soon after <purchabr>CSR</purchabr>'s earlier
reported statement that it will sell its {Delhi Petroleum Pty
Ltd} unit to an Exxon Corp {XON} unit for 985 mln dlrs and not
proceed with the previously announced float of part of Delhi.

<purchaser>AUSTRALIAN GAS LIGHT CO</purchaser> COUNTER-BIDS FOR <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr>
    SYDNEY, April - {<purchaser>The Australian Gas Light Co</purchaser>} (<purchabr>AGL</purchabr>) said it
<status>will offer</status> one share plus one dlr cash for every two shares in
oil and gas producer {<acquired>TMOC Resources Ltd</acquired>} in a counter-bid to
the previously reported takeover offer by Santos Ltd {STOS.S}.
    The offer values <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr> shares at 4.75 dlrs each, based on
<purchabr>AGL</purchabr>'s closing price of 8.50 dlrs on Friday. <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr> shares jumped
to 4.60 dlrs on the announcement from its Friday closing price
of 4.15.
    The <purchabr>AGL</purchabr> offer, the third to be made for <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr> this year,
compares with the Santos cash offer of 4.00 dlrs a share.
    Based on <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr>'s issued capital of 62.08 mln shares, the <purchabr>AGL</purchabr>
offer values the entire company at 249.9 mln shares.
    <purchabr>AGL</purchabr> said in a statement that it already holds 10.5 pct of
<acqabr>TMOC</acqabr>'s issued capital. This compares with the Santos stake of
3.1 pct when it announced its bid in March 23.
    {Elders Resources Ltd} began the auction for <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr> about
three months ago with an unsuccessful 2.55 dlrs a share
on-market offer that has since lapsed.
    <purchabr>AGL</purchabr> said its offer is above the upper end of the range of
values placed on <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr> by its advisers in the company's response
urging rejection of the Elders Resources bid.
    <purchabr>AGL</purchabr> said it will make the same offer for <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr>'s convertible
notes. Accepting share and note holders will participate in
AGL's planned one-for-one bonus issue.
    It said <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr> is already a partner with <purchabr>AGL</purchabr> in the Alice
Springs to Darwin gas pipeline and has a number of businesses
complementary with those of <purchabr>AGL</purchabr>.
    <purchabr>AGL</purchabr> is the New South Wales natural gas utility while <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr>

which <acqabr>Hutton</acqabr> will terminate its merger agreement with Purolator
Courier Corp and its pending 35-dlr-per-share tender offer,

    Under its merger agreement, <acqabr>Hutton</acqabr> has the right to
unilaterally terminate the merger agreement under certain
circumstances, including its receipt of less than 66-2/3 pct of
Purolator shares or the start of a higher competing tender

    <purchabr>Emery</purchabr> said pending the termination of PC Acquisition's
merger agreement, PC has released Purolator from an agreement
not to discuss <purchabr>Emery</purchabr>'s acquisition proposal with <purchabr>Emery</purchabr>. <purchabr>Emery</purchabr>

PC Acquisition's right to receive fees that Purolator agreed to

due to the acquisition of control by another party.
    The company said it has also agreed to let Purolator pay

TAKEOVER BATTLE FOR <acqabr>DOME PETROLEUM</acqabr> BEGINS
    By Solange De Santis, Reuters
    TORONTO, April 13 - A <status>takeover battle</status> began today for
debt-burdened <acquired>Dome Petroleum Ltd</acquired> {<acqcode>DMP.MO</acqcode>} as <purchaser>TransCanada
PipeLines Ltd</purchaser> {<purchcode>TRP.TO</purchcode>} announced a <dlramt>4.3 billion dlr</dlramt> offer and
<acqabr>Dome</acqabr> said it is <status>continuing talks with other possible buyers</status>.
    Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential
buyers for <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> include Imperial Oil Ltd {IMO.A} which is 70
pct owned by Exxon Corp {XON.N}, {PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd}
which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd
{CP.N} and British Petroleum Co Plc {BP.L}.
    Along with the <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr> offer, <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> has had another
proposal from "a substantial company" and discussions with a
third company which could lead to an offer, <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> said in a
statement.
    The statement confirmed <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> received <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s bid,
but did not identify the companies involved in talks.
    <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline
operator, said it is offering <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> a package of cash, common
and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which
would own and operate <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s assets. <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr> said the offer
is to <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> management, not to shareholders.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> has massive <acqbus>oil and gas</acqbus> landholdings in <acqloc>Canada</acqloc>,
totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.
It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s statement said the <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr> announcement "violated
the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered
into with prospective purchasers" and was apparently timed to
prevent Dome from considering other proposals.
    It said the <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr> bid "seems to require favourable and
substantial taxation concessions from the federal and
provincial governments." But <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> added that its management and
financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.
    <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr> chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he
was surprised at the vehemence of <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s statement and denied
that <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr> was trying to usurp other bids. "I find (<acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s
statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to
authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce
it," he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the
other bidders, or the terms of other offers.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at
5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.

OFFER FOR <acqabr>DOME</acqabr> MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS
    By Larry Welsh, Reuters
    NEW YORK, April 13 - A <dlramt>3.22 billion dlr</dlramt> <status>offer</status> for <acquired>Dome
Petroleum Ltd</acquired> {<acqcode>DMP.MO</acqcode>} by <purchaser>TransCanada Pipelines Ltd</purchaser> {<purchcode>TRP.TO</purchcode>}
may short-circuit <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s restructuring plan and open the door
for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
substantial payments to creditors will expire.
    Analysts said <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s bid signals <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s debtholders
that an alternative exists to <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s debt plan.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
negotiations.
    <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s proposal "amounts to a quasi debt
restructuring," oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
Ltd said from Toronto.
    <acqloc>Calgary</acqloc>-based <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s restructuring plan would allow
creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
    "The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
<acqabr>Dome</acqabr> will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,"
said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
Calgary.
    <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s announcement came as a surprise since <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>
was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
refinancing packages, Gobert said.
    The <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr> proposal could open the bidding for <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>
since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
to agree to a restructuring, he added.
    "I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
any and all offers (for <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>)," Gobert said.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
<purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
the bidding price for <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> and an effort to preclude other
possible buyers from making an offer. "By drawing attention to
us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
reluctant to come forward," he said.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> does not consider <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s proposal a formal
offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> responded to the statement by suspending discussions
with <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr> in order to pursue talks with other
unidentified parties. However, <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> said its management and
financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
<purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s.
    Gowland said <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s offer is probably a fair price
for the company's 36.1 mln acres of <acqbus>oil and gas</acqbus> land holdings.
    However, he said not enough financial details are known
about <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s debt restructuring to compare the value of
<purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s proposed offer.

<acqabr>REVLON</acqabr> {<acqcode>REV</acqcode>} AND <purchabr>MACANDREWS AND FORBES</purchabr> TO MERGE
    NEW YORK, April 13 - {<purchaser>MacAndrews and Forbes Group</purchaser>} and

<acqabr>Revlon</acqabr> at 20.10 dlrs per common share in cash.

    The companies said the tender offer and withdrawal rights

material with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc is acting as dealer-manager for the offer,
the companies said.
    <acqabr>Revlon</acqabr> currently has about 42 mln shares outstanding. The

CANADA STOCKS/<acquired>DOME PETROLEUM LTD</acquired> {<acqcode>DMP</acqcode>}
    TORONTO, April 13 - <acquired>Dome Petroleum Ltd</acquired> shares moved higher

made a <dlramt>4.3 billion Canadian dlr</dlramt> bid for <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> and <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> said it
is in talks with two other unidentified companies.
    Market speculation is that the other two potential bidders
are not Canadian companies and DuPont's {DD} Conoco and
Atlantic Richfield Co {ARC} are mentioned as possibilities,
Wilf Gobert of Peters and Co Ltd said.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange.
<purchabr>TransCanada PipeLines</purchabr> was down 1/4 at 15-3/4 on the New York

    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> was the most active stock on the Toronto exchange at
1.50 dlrs per share, up 37 cts.
    Gobert characterized the market action in <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> as "awfully
optimistic" but said investors are hoping for a competing offer
to the shareholders.
    <purchabr>TransCanada PipeLines</purchabr>' offer is to <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> management, not to
shareholders. However, it proposes issuing new equity in a
subsidiary that would operate <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> assets. Current <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>

    After the company's annual meeting, Rober Mercer,
<sellerabr>Goodyear</sellerabr>'s chairman and chief executive officer, also said 
<sellerabr>Goodyear</sellerabr> expects to report a profit of more than one dlr a
share from continuing operations in the first quarter. In the

    Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying
<acqabr>Celeron</acqabr> and they may form a consortium to buy the unit.
    <acqabr>Celeron</acqabr> consists of <acqbus>oil and gas</acqbus> reserves and an almost
complete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara,
Calif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said <acqabr>Celeron</acqabr>'s reserves
would not be sold separately from the pipeline.
    Concerning speculation that <dlramt>two billion dlr</dlramt> price tag for
<acqabr>Celeron</acqabr> was too high, Mercer said "There is no fire sale going
on here and we can continue to keep <acqabr>Celeron</acqabr> as a profitable
operation throughout the year."
    Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit was
based on the new share total after <sellerabr>Goodyear</sellerabr>'s share repurchase

    TORONTO, April 13 - <purchaser>Nova</purchaser>, an Alberta Corp, chief executive

remains under Canadian ownership, but added that his company
<status>plans no bid</status> of its own for debt-troubled <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>.
    "We've no plan to bid," Blair told reporters after a speech

pct-owned Husky Oil Ltd {HYO} were interested in <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s
extensive <acqloc>Western Canadian</acqloc> energy holdings.
    "But being interested can sometimes be different from
making a bid," Blair said.
    TransCanada PipeLines Ltd {TRP} yesterday bid 4.30 billion
dlrs for <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>, but <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> said it was discontinuing talks with
TransCanada and was considering a proposal from another company
and was also talking with another possible buyer, both rumored
to be offshore.
    Asked by reporters if <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> should remain in Canadian hands,
Blair replied, "Yes. I think that we still need to be building
as much Canadian position in this industry as we can and I
think it would be best if <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> ends up in the hands of Canadian
management."
    He said he did not know who other possible bidders were.
    Blair said that any move to put <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s financial house in
order "will remove one of the general problems of attitude that
have hung over Western Canadian industry."
    He added, however, that the energy industry still faced "a
couple of tough, tough additional years."
    Asked about <purchabr>Nova</purchabr>'s 1987 prospects, Blair predicted that
<purchabr>Nova</purchabr>'s net profit would rise this year to more than 150 mln

<purchabr>AMOCO</purchabr> {<purchcode>AN</purchcode>} MAY BUY <acqabr>DOME</acqabr> {<acqcode>DMP</acqcode>}, REPORT SAYS
    Toronto, April 17 - <purchaser>Amoco Corp</purchaser> is apparently the successful
bidder for debt-laden <acquired>Dome Petroleum Ltd</acquired>, according to a
published report.
    The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to the
negotiations, today said <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> broke off talks last night with
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3
billion Canadian dlr offer for all of <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s assets.
    No financial details about the <purchabr>Amoco</purchabr> offer were available
and a <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that <purchabr>Amoco</purchabr>
had emerged the winner, the newspaper said.
    However, the <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> spokesman indicated that the sale of <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>
could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and
Mail said.
    Representatives of <purchabr>Amoco</purchabr> were not immediately available for
comment.
    Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>
said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused
to identify them.
    Since then, market speculation has centered on <purchabr>Amoco</purchabr> and
Exxon Corp's {XON} 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in
Canada.
    British Petroleum PLC {BP} and Royal Dutch/Shell Group {RD}
have also been mentioned as possible suitors for <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>.
    In the past two days, <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> management has been pressured by
the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,
the only Canadian company in the bidding.
    Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want
to avoid a <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> sale to a foreign company since the government
gave <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to
encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and
officials have said.
    A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run
afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is
asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is
trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,
analysts have said.
    A takeover by <purchabr>Amoco</purchabr> or Imperial would also give a foreign
oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry.
    Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company,
with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based
<purchabr>Amoco</purchabr> had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its <purchabr>Amoco</purchabr>
Canada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by <purchaser>Amoco Corp</purchaser>.

SORO GROUP TO LIMIT <acqabr>FAIRCHILD</acqabr> {<acqcode>FEN</acqcode>} STOCK BUYS
    WASHINGTON, April 21 - <purchaser>Quantum Fund N.V.</purchaser>, a Netherlands
Antilles mutual fund for which New York investor George Soros
is investment adviser, said it has <status>agreed to limit</status> further
purchases of <acquired>Fairchild Industries Inc</acquired> stock.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
<purchabr>Quantum</purchabr>, which already holds 1,647,481 <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> common shares,
or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding, said it agreed to the
restriction after <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> said its security clearance might
be jeopardized if <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> acquires a major stake in it.
    But <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> said <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> management was told that Soros,
acting either individually or through entities other than
<purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> that he controls, may decide to buy common stock in the
company on his own behalf.
    <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> had recently notified the Federal Trade Commission
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
that it might buy up to 49.9 pct of <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr>'s voting stock.
Unless the FTC had objected, <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> would have been free, but
not obligated, to buy up to 49.9 pct of <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> stock.
    <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> management, however, warned that if <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr>, a
foreign entity, raises its stake in the company to 49.9 pct, it
could "impair" the government security clearances <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr>
needs to carry out its its defense contract work.
    In response, <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> said it told <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> it will not
make "significant additional purchases" of its common or
preferred stock without giving <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> enough prior notice to
enable it to consult with <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> over the impact of action.
    <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> also said it has withdrawn its notification request
to the FTC and the antitrust division of the Justice Department
of its intent to buy up to 49.9 pct of <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr>.
    <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> also said it told the FTC and the Justice
Department that it does not expect to resubmit any further
notifications of intent to significantly raise its stake in
<acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> at this time.
    The restrictions <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> has agreed to follow regarding
further dealings in <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> stock do not apply to Soros as an
individual investor.
     <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr>'s annual shareholders meeting is scheduled to be

<acquired>Monier Ltd</acquired> {<acqcode>MNRA.S</acqcode>}, currently the subject of a 3.80 dlrs a
share bid by CSR Ltd {CSRA.S}.
    Alternatively, <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> will offer three shares plus 82 cents
cash for each <acqabr>Monier</acqabr> share, it said in a statement.
    As previously reported, <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> moved into the market for
<acqabr>Monier</acqabr> shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by
Friday.
    It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign
Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> is classified as
foreign because of its New Zealand base.
    The <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> cash offer values <acqabr>Monier</acqabr>'s issued capital of 156.28
mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid.
    Based on the current price of <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> shares of 1.05 dlrs, the
alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> said the
value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the
diluted asset backing of <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> as at March 31.
    <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> said the offer will have no minimum acceptance
conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment
and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.
    <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the
shareholding in <acqabr>Monier</acqabr> was a long term investment.
    <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> and its {Feltex International Ltd} associate have
targetted the <acqbus>building products</acqbus> sector as an area of expansion
and <acqabr>Monier</acqabr> fits well with this aim, he added.
    <acqabr>Monier</acqabr> chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement
that the independent directors of <acqabr>Monier</acqabr> intend to recommend
acceptance of the <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> bid in the absence of a higher bid.
    He also said <acqabr>Monier</acqabr> will not now proceed with the
one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on
March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.
    As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex
put and call option deal with <acqabr>Monier</acqabr>'s major shareholder,
Redland Plc {RDLD.L}, which gives Redland the choice of
accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to
50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing.
    CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland
taking the second option, resulting in the two companies
running <acqabr>Monier</acqabr> as a joint venture.
    CSR officials have also said they had no intention of
raising the company's bid for <acqabr>Monier</acqabr> after <purchabr>ETL</purchabr>'s intervention
became public last week.

<purchabr>STAD ROTTERDAM</purchabr> TAKES STAKE IN SWISS-OWNED INSURER
    ROTTERDAM, June 2 - Dutch insurer <purchaser>Stad Rotterdam Anno 1720
N.V.</purchaser> {<purchcode>ASRN.AS</purchcode>} said from July 1 it will own 20 pct of the
shares of {<acquired>Europeesche Verzekering Maatschappij N.V.</acquired>}, a

    <purchabr>Stad Rotterdam</purchabr> chairman Lucas van Leeuwen told Reuters it
may raise its stake to a majority interest if the two companies
are found to be sufficiently compatible.
    Van Leeuwen said that due partly to the fact <acqabr>Europeesche</acqabr>
made losses in 1985 and 1986, the 20 pct stake was obtained at
below the shares' intrinsic value. He gave no precise sum.
    The <acqabr>Europeesche</acqabr>, which specialises in <acqbus>travel and recreation
insurance</acqbus>, had a premium income of 150 mln guilders in 1986.
    <purchabr>Stad Rotterdam</purchabr>'s premium income in 1986 was 1.17 billion
guilders, making it the fifth largest Dutch insurer.
    <acqabr>Europeesche</acqabr> made a loss of nine mln guilders in 1985, which
narrowed to 4.5 mln guilders in 1986, van Leeuwen said.
    He said the company was on course for independent recovery

and W.R. Grace {WR} both have joint ventures with <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr>, but
neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes.
    <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr> has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic
products and with Grace to develop agricultural products.
    Earlier, <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> and <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr> announced in a joint statement 
an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop
new biotechnology products in several fields.
   
    As part of the deal <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> will license several of <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr>'
anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.
<purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but
not in North American and Western Europe.
    "We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood
that <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr> wants to build its own fully integrated business in
North America and Europe," said Fildes.
    He said <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> was the good partner because <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> has a
major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its
own in that market.
   
    Fildes said <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr> has shunned licensing arrangements with
pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own
business. Many large corporations have invested in small
biotech firms.
    But <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr>'s investment in <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr> is the first it has made
in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr>
because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship
with a large number of other biotechnology companies."
   
    Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug
areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to "keep the
biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves."
    Fildes said the partnership with <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> would be used to
broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas
as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory
markets.
    <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> is also investming 75 mln dlrs in <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr>' research
over the next five years.
   
    "<purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and
development to make it happen, while the equity position part
of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this
partnership," said Fildes.

<purchabr>BANK OF NEW YORK</purchabr> REAFFIRMS TERMS FOR <acqabr>IRVING</acqabr> {<acqcode>V</acqcode>}
    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - The <purchaser>Bank of New York Corp</purchaser> {<purchcode>BK</purchcode>} said it
<status>reaffirmed the terms</status> of its offer for <acquired>Irving Bank Corp</acquired> despite
the drop in the <purchabr>Bank of New York</purchabr>'s share price to 30-1/8, a
<purchabr>Bank of New York</purchabr> spokesman said.
    "The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer," a
<purchabr>Bank of New York</purchabr> spokesman said.
    <acqabr>Irving</acqabr> would not comment on how the drop in the market
affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back
any of its own shares.
    Earlier this month, <acqabr>Irving</acqabr> rejected the bid as inadequate
and said it wanted to retain its independence.
    In late September, <purchabr>Bank of New York</purchabr> offered 80 dlrs per
share in cash for 47.4 pct of <acqabr>Irving</acqabr>. For the remaining 52.6
pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one
<acqabr>Irving</acqabr> share.
    At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to
80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per
share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.
    According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender
for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.
    Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would
affect the acquisition.
    "If it gets to the <acqabr>Irving</acqabr> shareholders, they would approve
it, but <acqabr>Irving</acqabr> hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,"
said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.
    "And the market is saying the deal won't go through,"
Alpert said.
    "The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at
present. If <acqabr>Irving</acqabr> wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a
share, then they won't go at a lower price," another analyst
said.
    The analyst also doubted that <purchabr>Bank of New York</purchabr> could afford
to retain its original offer.
    However, industry sources were more uncertain about
prospects for the deal.
    "With <acqabr>Irving</acqabr>'s price so low, <purchabr>Bank of New York</purchabr>'s offer will
look good to <acqabr>Irving</acqabr> shareholders," said Michael Flores, a
consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm.
    The drop of <acqabr>Irving</acqabr>'s share to 44 dlrs per share, which is
about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases
the chance that <purchabr>Bank of New York</purchabr> will succeed, Flores said.
    Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely
to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking
industry.
    "Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use
their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price
is too depressed," Alpert said.
    Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other
possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said.
    "In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered
more than the acquirees," another analyst said.

there's no reason for us to change," said Daniel Good, head of
Shearson Lehman merchant banking.
    "Things are proceeding as planned, and we fully expect that

<purchabr>HUGHES TOOL</purchabr> {<purchcode>HT</purchcode>} SAYS <acqabr>BAKER</acqabr> {<acqcode>BKO</acqcode>} MERGER ALIVE
    HOUSTON, March 5 - <purchaser>Hughes Tool Co</purchaser> Chairman W.A. Kistler
said its counter proposal to merge with <acquired>Baker International
Corp</acquired> was still <status>under consideration</status> and that a merger was in the
best interests of both companies.
    "Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that is
good for both companies," Kistler said of the proposed merger
that would result in a 1.2 billion dlr <acqbus>oil field service</acqbus>
company. "We're working very hard on this merger."
    <purchabr>Hughes</purchabr>' board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting
to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11
to give <acqabr>Baker</acqabr> more time to consider the counter proposal.
    The <purchabr>Hughes</purchabr> board, which had previously expressed concern
about a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would
require <acqabr>Baker</acqabr> to sell its drilling bit operations and
submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to
terminate the proposed merger.
    The <purchabr>Hughes</purchabr> board made a counter proposal that the two
companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses
before signing the decree.
    The directors of <acqabr>Baker</acqabr> immediately after receiving the
counter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state
court to force to <purchabr>Hughes</purchabr> to complete the merger.
    "The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might
be imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous
about what the outcome might be," Kistler said, in explaining
why Hughes had made the counter proposal.
    "We need additional time to understand why Baker did not
accept our proposal."
    Kistler also said that the law suit filed by <acqabr>Baker</acqabr> "was not
a factor" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal
on the table.
    He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit.
    Kistler said <purchabr>Hughes</purchabr> would be willing to consider a
compromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific.
    The Justice Department in January said it would block the
<purchabr>Hughes</purchabr> and <acqabr>Baker</acqabr> merger on anti-trust grounds unless both
companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide
for the sale of the assets after the merger took place.
    The <purchabr>Hughes</purchabr> board said it would not sign the decree because
its was too "unreasonable." <purchabr>Hughes</purchabr> said that <acqabr>Baker</acqabr> should
instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the
merger is finalized and given government approval.
    Under the decree, if <acqabr>Baker</acqabr> is unable to find acceptable
buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is
approved, a federal trustee would become responsible for
finding a buyer.
    Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take
up to 10 years to complete the sales.
    He also expressed concern that the combined companies might
be required by the government's conditions to license some of
its technology to any purchaser of the assets.
    <acqabr>Baker</acqabr> said last night in a statement that the required
assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs,
representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined
companies.

approval process.  It said the investment should provide the
necessary capital to complete the FDA review process and

    The drugs are PEG-superoxide disdmutase and PEG-catalase,
for use against oxygen toxicity disorders that cause the

52 dlr per share takeover offer for <acqabr>USAir</acqabr> would in no way

{PIE}.
    Buckstein said <purchabr>TWA</purchabr> asked the court to enjoin the
enforcement of <acqabr>USAir</acqabr>'s shareholder rights plan, or "poison
pill." Such provisions, which typically allow for the issue of
securities to shareholders in the event of a hostile takeover
bid, are aimed at deterring takeovers by making them more
expensive.
    <acqabr>USAir</acqabr> earlier today rejected <purchabr>TWA</purchabr>'s offer, saying <purchabr>TWA</purchabr>'s bid

<sellerabr>DOME</sellerabr>{<sellercode>DMP</sellercode>} REPEATS DOME <acqabr>MINES</acqabr>{<acqcode>DM</acqcode>} STAKE FOR SALE
    TORONTO, March 6 - <seller>Dome Petroleum Ltd</seller>'s 23.2 pct stake of
gold producer <acquired>Dome Mines Ltd</acquired> <status>continues to be for sale</status> "at the
right price," spokesman David Annesley said in response to an
inquiry.
    Reaffirming remarks made last year by chairman Howard
Macdonald, Annesley said the company is considering selling its
stake in <acqabr>Dome Mines</acqabr>.
    Concerning <sellerabr>Dome Petroleum</sellerabr>'s 42 pct stake in {Encor Energy
Corp Ltd}, Annesley said "Encor is a strategic investment for
<sellerabr>Dome</sellerabr>, and we have no intention of selling it."
    <sellerabr>Dome</sellerabr> spokesman Annesley said in answer to a question that
he was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward the
sale of <sellerabr>Dome Petroleum</sellerabr>'s 20.9 mln <acqabr>Dome Mines</acqabr> shares.
    He also declined to specify at what price the company would
consider selling it shares.
    "Clearly today's prices of more than 15 dlrs a share (of
<acqabr>Dome Mines</acqabr> stock) are very attractive," Annesley commented.
    "We were considering the sale 'at the right price' at a time
when the shares were priced around nine to 10 dlrs," he added. A
price of around 15 dlrs a share would be considered "fairly
attractive," Annesley said.
    Annesley also <sellerabr>Dome Petroleum</sellerabr> may be able to sell its <acqabr>Dome
Mines</acqabr>' shares at a premium to market prices. "There might be an
opportunity to pick up a premium on that because it would be
virtually a control block in <acqabr>Dome Mines</acqabr>," he said.
    <acqabr>Dome Mines</acqabr> shares traded earlier at 15-1/4 dlrs, off 1/4 on
the Toronto Stock Exchange.
    <sellerabr>Dome Petroleum</sellerabr> is now negotiating a plan to restructure
debt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs with a group of 56

<seller>NORDBANKEN</seller> TO AUCTION ITS <acqabr>FERMENTA</acqabr> SHARES
    STOCKHOLM, March 6 - Sweden's {<seller>Nordbanken</seller>} banking group
said it would sell the 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loan
collateral by <acquired>Fermenta AB</acquired>'s {<acqcode>FRMS.ST</acqcode>} founder and former chief
executive Refaat el-Sayed and it planned to buy them up itself.
    The bank said the sale - by public auction on March 16 --
was because of a debtor's inability to repay an overdue loan.
    The B free shares closed at 16.50 crowns on the bourse's
unofficial list -- down from a peak of 300 in January 1986.
Nordbanken said it did not exclude accepting a suitable bid for
the shares although it expected to buy them back itself.
    The statement said the sale did not represent any
withdrawal from <sellerabr>Nordbanken</sellerabr>'s undertakings towards the <acqabr>Fermenta</acqabr>
group and that it had been sanctioned by the other main
shareholders.
    <sellerabr>Nordbanken</sellerabr> is <acqabr>Fermenta</acqabr>'s third largest creditor with loans
of 155 mln crowns. It was one of the four Swedish banks which
last month agreed to advance the group 110 mln crowns to solve
its immediate liquidity problems. Together with two other main
shareholders, it also advanced <acqabr>Fermenta</acqabr> an additional 65 mln
crowns until a new equity issue could be made.
    <acqabr>Fermenta</acqabr> is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders'
meeting on Tuesday to approve the planned equity issue.
    <sellerabr>Nordbanken</sellerabr> had to make a provision against a 200 mln crown
loan to el-Sayed in its 1986 results.
    <acqabr>Fermenta</acqabr>'s new management originally hoped to raise 160 mln
crowns through the new one for four rights issue and an extra
170 mln from an issue to <sellerabr>Nordbanken</sellerabr>, another major creditor and
shareholder {Gotabanken} and the group's new majority owner
{Industrivarden AB}.
    The share price was to be 20 crowns. But there has been
doubt over the plans since the stock fell below this level this
week after <acqabr>Fermenta</acqabr>'s former chairman Kjell Brandstrom said the
company was in a much worse state than he thought.

<purchabr>SOSNOFF</purchabr> STARTS BID FOR <acqabr>CAESARS WORLD</acqabr> {<acqcode>CAW</acqcode>}
    NEW YORK, March 9 - {<purchaser>MTS Acquisition Corp</purchaser>}, a company
formed by Martin T. Sosnoff, said it has <status>started a tender offer</status>
for all shares of <acquired>Caesars World Inc</acquired> at 28 dlrs each.
    In a newspaper advertisement, <purchabr>MTS</purchabr> said the offer and
withdrawal rights expire April Three unless extended.
    Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns about four mln
of <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr>' 30.3 mln shares outstanding, or about 13.3 pct, and
is <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr>' largest shareholder.  <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr> owns <acqbus>casino hotels</acqbus> in
<acqloc>Nevada</acqloc> and <acqbus>honeymoon resorts</acqbus> in <acqloc>Pennsylvania's Pocono
Mountains</acqloc>.  It also controls Caesars New Jersey Inc {CJN},
which owns an Atlantic City, N.J., casino hotel.
    For the second quarter ended January 31, <acqabr>Caesars World</acqabr>
earned 12.6 mln dlrs on revenues of 190.4 mln dlrs, up from
earnings of 7,500,000 dlrs and revenues of 163.8 mln dlrs a
year before.  For all of fiscal 1986, the company earned 41.0
mln dlrs on revenues of 694.4 mln dlrs.
    <purchabr>MTS</purchabr> said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least
enough shares to give Sosnoff a majority interest on a fully
diluted basis, the arrangement of sufficient financing to buy
all <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr> shares not already owned and pay related costs and
approval by the New Jersey Casino control Commission and the
NEvada Gaming Commission and State Gaming Control Board.
    <purchabr>MTS</purchabr> said Marine Midland Banks Inc {MM} has committed to
lend it 100 mln dlrs for the acquisition and use its best
efforts to syndicate another 400 mln dlrs in senior financing
for the transaction.
    It said its financial adviser, PaineWebber Group Inc {PWJ},
has stated in writing that subject to market conditions, it is
highly confident that it can arrange commitments for up to 475
mln dlrs in "mezzanine" financing.
    <purchabr>MTS</purchabr> said it does not expect problems in obtaining New
Jersey and Nevada regulatory approval for the acquisition,
since ownership in a <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr> stake has already been cleared.
    In June 1986, Sosnoff requested a seat on the <acqabr>Caesars World</acqabr>
board, a request that has not yet been granted.  In September
1986, Sosnoff, who is chairman of {Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital
Corp}, filed for clearance under U.S. antitrust laws to raise
his interest in <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr> World to 25 pct.
    Sosnoff said, in a letter to <acqabr>Caesars World</acqabr> chairman and
chief executive officer Henry Gluck, that "The decision to go
directly to the shareholders was made at the urging of may
financial and legal advisors, who repeatedly stressed to me the
lack of responsiveness of the management in the past."
    Sosnoff, who said he has made numerous efforts to express
his views to management on ways of maximizing shareholder
values, said <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr> twicce refused his request for a board
seat.  "My advisers felt that, had I given you advance notice,
you would have used the time to throw up obstacles to my offer
rather than giving it serious consideration," he said.
    Sosnoff said he hopes that <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr> World management will be
willing to negotiate an acquisition agreement with him.
    "As I have indicated publicly in the past, I believe
operating management of the company has performed well and that
appropriate consideration should be given to a significant
equity interest for them in the company following the
acquisition," Sosnoff said in the letter to Gluck.
    <purchabr>MTS</purchabr> said Sosnoff has asked the company to fix March 27 as
the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled
to authorize action without a meeting -- including the election
or removal of directors.

WALL STREET STOCKS/<purchabr>CHRYSLER</purchabr> {<purchcode>C</purchcode>}, <acqabr>AMC</acqabr> {<acqcode>AMO</acqcode>}
    DETROIT, March 9 - The proposed <dlramt>757 mln dlr</dlramt> deal under
which <purchaser>Chrysler Corp</purchaser> would acquire <acquired>American Motors Corp</acquired> was
described by analysts as a reasonable deal for both companies.
    Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said <acqabr>AMC</acqabr> common
stock could be fairly valued at "just under five dlrs a share"
given changes brought by tax reform and that <purchabr>Chrysler</purchabr>'s offer
to pay four dlrs a share of <purchabr>Chrysler</purchabr> stock to <acqabr>AMC</acqabr> holders other
than Renault as a "a good price for <purchabr>Chrysler</purchabr>.
    <acqabr>AMC</acqabr> common shares opened at four dlrs this morning after
the Renault-Chrysler announcement, up 3/8, while <purchabr>Chrysler</purchabr>
shares lost 1/4 to 52-1/4.
    Though <acqabr>AMC</acqabr> issued a statement saying that it was studying
the proposed buyout and had no other comment, Glantz said he
regarded the proposal as a "done deal" because "I can't believe
anybody else would make a bid."
    "It's a reasonable deal for both sides," the analyst told
Reuters.
    "<purchabr>Chrysler</purchabr> gets the jeep franchise and the (new <acqabr>AMC</acqabr>)
Bramalea, Ontario, plant and the (new Renault) Premier
(mid-sized car) and <acqabr>AMC</acqabr>'s sales will go up because buyers will
have more confidence that the manufacturer will still be around
to service the products," Glantz said.
    Analyst Thomas O'Grady said <purchabr>Chrysler</purchabr> would be getting more
manufacturing capacity, including a brand-new plant in Canada,
for a bargain price and Renault would be getting some return
after its prolonged loss-making investment in <acqabr>AMC</acqabr>.

<acqabr>HUGHES</acqabr> {<acqcode>HT</acqcode>} APPROVES MERGER WITH <purchabr>BAKER</purchabr> {<purchcode>BKO</purchcode>}
    HOUSTON, March 11 - An overwhelming majority of <acquired>Hughes Tool
Co</acquired> shareholders <status>approved</status> a merger agreement with <purchaser>Baker
International Corp</purchaser> based on revised terms that allow the
companies additional time to sell a drilling bit business as
required by the U.S. Justice Department.
     Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of
the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how
much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on
the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold.
    An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a
funding limit.
    The <purchabr>Baker</purchabr>-<acqabr>Hughes</acqabr> merger, which would would create a 1.2
billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell through
earlier this month when <acqabr>Hughes</acqabr> balked at terms of a proposed
Justice Department consent decree that would have given the
companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed
business.
    <purchabr>Baker</purchabr> said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr
lawsuit it had filed to force <acqabr>Hughes</acqabr> to follow through with the
merger.
    <acqabr>Hughes</acqabr>' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct of
<acqabr>Hughes</acqabr>' shareholders approved the merger, said the revised
terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a
buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous
agreement had proposed a three-month period.
    Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would
consider granting, if necessary, an additional three-month
extension to complete the sale.
    He said there were "several people looking" at the domestic
drilling bit business.
    The companies, Kistler said, have also decided to
voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore.
    Kistler estimated that the merger, which should be
completed in about two weeks, will result in annual cost
savings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects "substantial
cutbacks" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc,
the name the merged company will take.
    Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies
should put the company on a profitable course. "We think that
in the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should see
something close to breakeven," he said.
    In the fourth quarter of 1986, <acqabr>Hughes</acqabr> earned 31.7 mln dlrs
on sales of 215.7 mln dlrs.
    <purchabr>Baker</purchabr>, in its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, lost
34.2 mln dlrs on revenues of 297.7 mln dlrs.

    There was no immediate comment from <purchabr>PDVSA</purchabr> officials in New

    The <acqabr>Corpus Christi refinery</acqabr> has a capacity of about 160,000
barrels per day, the <sellerabr>Union Pacific</sellerabr> spokesman said, and is a
largely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the

    The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution
assets by <purchabr>PDVSA</purchabr> has been expected as Venezuela has been moving
aggressively to enhance its role in the <acqbus>oil</acqbus> industry from
producer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector.
    Purchase of part of Champlin's operations also fits a
profile which <purchabr>PDVSA</purchabr> officials have said previously they looked
for in any acquisition.
    One <purchabr>PDVSA</purchabr> official said the company was looking for
independent <acqbus>oil</acqbus> companies with good refinery and distribution
network and a strong regional presence.
    The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed
its earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp's
{SLC} Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary.
    In that agreement signed September 15, 1986, <purchabr>PDVSA</purchabr> paid
Southland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgo's stock.

unanimously <status>rejected</status> a 28 dlr a share takeover offer by New

    <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr> said <purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr>'s offer to by all its outstanding

interests of its shareholders.
    The company recommended that shareholders reject <purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr>'s

any of their shares.
    <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr> said it will explore a variety of alternative

    <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr>, in a brief statement, did not say whether it would
seek to buy back its shares held by <purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr>.

    On Wednesday, <purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr> told the Securities and Exchange
Commission that he controls 13.6 pct of the company's stock.
    <purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr> also informed the SEC that <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr> had offered to
buyout his holdings several times during the past year.
    No one from the <purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr> organization was immediately

    <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr> said its financial advisor, Drexel Burnham Lambert

inadequate for shareholders other than <purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr>.
    The company said other factors it considered in rejecting
the offer were its financial condition, future prospects,
current market conditions and the numerous conditions on which
<purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr>'s bid was conditioned.
    <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr>' stock opened up 1/8 point at 28-1/8. That is 1/8

invest <dlramt>800 mln pesos</dlramt>, assuming a purchase price of 100 pesos a

    The shares involved in the proposal were part of the block
of 38 mln shares owned by the United Coconut Planters Bank
(UCPB) and sequestered by the government.
    The block is split between class A and class B stock.
    <acqabr>SMC</acqabr> also proposed to sell a further five mln shares to A.N.
Soriano Corp, the family company of <acqabr>San Miguel</acqabr> president Andres
Soriano, del Rosario said.
    The shares are worth some 500 mln pesos at recent prices.
    Del Rosario said the 14 mln B shares in the block which are
open to foreign ownership would probably be sold to
unidentified foreign purchasers.
    He said <acqabr>SMC</acqabr> and UCPB would meet later this week to try to
resolve disputes over the pricing of the shares.
    President Corazon Aquino earlier this month established an
arbitration panel to settle a row over the disposal of the
shares.
    Their initial sale to Soriano through <acqabr>SMC</acqabr> Hong Kong unit
Neptunia Corp was blocked by the Presidential Commission on
Good Government.
    The commission sequestered the stock on suspicion that the

loan stock certificates belonging to the company's chairman,

    Khoo is a major shareholder of the {National Bank of Brunei

dlrs had been extended to Khoo-related firms without
documentation or guarantee.
    The <acqabr>Goodwood</acqabr> securities are now held by the Commercial
Affairs Investigation Department, the banking sources said. The

    The government move is aimed at protecting <acqabr>Goodwood</acqabr>'s

NBB, the banking sources said.
    <acqabr>Goodwood</acqabr> had a total of 87.3 mln dlrs in fixed deposits,

<acqabr>VEBA</acqabr> SHARE PLACEMENT STILL EXPECTED THIS MONTH
    BONN, March 18 - The sale of the government's 25.55 pct
stake in <acquired>VEBA AG</acquired> {<acqcode>VEBG.F</acqcode>} is <status>still expected</status> this month, banking
sources closely linked with the transaction said.
    A spokesman for the <seller>Finance Ministry</seller> said no exact date had
yet been set for the privatisation, which the government has
tabled for the second half of March. However, he added a
scandal at Volkswagen AG {VOWG.F}, VW, over currency losses "has
nothing to do" with the timing of the <acqabr>VEBA</acqabr> sale.
    Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has said the sale of
the Federal government's stake in VW, originally scheduled for
later this year, may be delayed because of the currency affair.
    A banker involved in the <acqabr>VEBA</acqabr> placement said "Nothing has
changed in the planning. I still presume that it will take
place in the second half of March."
    This banker said there would be no reason to postpone the
issue of the 10 mln <acqabr>VEBA</acqabr> shares for a few days. He added that
the consortium which is arranging the deal had completed its
preparatory work, although the price had not been decided.
    The <acqabr>VEBA</acqabr> share has been weaker ahead of the placement but
<acqloc>West German</acqloc> stocks have been generally bearish and news of the
VW scandal last week put further pressure on the market.

<purchabr>DIXONS</purchabr> HAS 56 PCT OF <acquired>CYCLOPS CORP</acquired>
    LONDON, March 18 - <purchaser>Dixons Group Plc</purchaser> {<purchcode>DXNS.L</purchcode>} said its

    This represents just over 54 pct of the outstanding shares

    PROVIDENCE, R.I., March 18 - <purchaser>Fleet Financial Group</purchaser> said
that its board and the board of <acquired>Norstar Bancorp</acquired> have <status>agreed</status> to
merge the two <acqbus>bank holding</acqbus> companies in a transaction which
would create a 23 billion dlr asset bank holding company.
    Under terms of the transaction, each <acqabr>Norstar</acqabr> shareholder
will receive 1.2 shares of <purchabr>Fleet</purchabr> common stock based on the
number of <purchabr>Fleet</purchabr> shares after giving effect to a previously
announced April one <purchabr>Fleet</purchabr> stock split.
     The two-for-one stock split will increase <purchabr>Fleet</purchabr>'s
currently 25.7 mln outstanding shares to 51.5 shares. There are
about 34.9 mln <acqabr>Norstar</acqabr> shares outstanding.
    <purchabr>Fleet</purchabr> said the deal is expected to be completed by July one
1988, the date on which the nationalization of Rhode Island's
interstate banking law takes effect.
    For the full year ended december 31, <purchabr>Fleet</purchabr>, a Rhode Island
based bank holding company, reported net income of 136.7 mln
dlrs and assets of 11.7 billion dlrs. <acqabr>Norstar</acqabr>, an <acqloc>Albany N.y.</acqloc>
<acqbus>holding</acqbus> company, reported net income of 104.8 mln dlrs and
assets of 11.1 billion dlrs.
     <purchabr>Fleet</purchabr> comptroller Irv Goss said it is estimated that the
transaction will result in minimal dilution in <purchabr>Fleet</purchabr>/<acqabr>Norstar</acqabr>
earnings per share. It is the intention of both companies that
cash quarterly dividends following the combination not decline
for either company's stock holders, the company said.
    For 1986, <acqabr>Norstar</acqabr> issued 1.31 dlrs annually in cash
dividends on its common stock. <purchabr>Fleet</purchabr>'s current annual
distibution on a pre-split basis would be equivalent to 1.68
dlrs a share.
    In addition, <purchabr>Fleet</purchabr> and <acqabr>Norstar</acqabr> have each granted the other
an option to purchase such number of authorized buy unissued
shares of common stock, that will constitute 24.99 pct of the

Gabelli and Co, plans to propose an anti-greenmail provision at
the <acquired>GenCorp Inc</acquired> annual meeting March 31, according to GAMCO
Chairman Mario Gabelli.
    Greenmail often involves the repurchase of shares at a
premium by a company from an unwanted investor. <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr> today
received a surprise tender offer from a group that holds 9.8
pct of its stock.
    Gabelli also said GAMCO has sent a 13-D filing to the
Securities and Exchange Commission on the 6.5 pct of GenCorp
stock held by GAMCO and its affiliates.
    The stock amounts to 1,462,000 shares and most of it was
reported in an earlier 13-G filing. A 13-G is filed by passive
investors to show holdings of more than five pct.
    Earlier today, <purchaser>General Partners</purchaser>, owned by Wagner and Brown
and AFG Industries Inc, launched a 100 dlr per share tender
offer for <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr>. Analysts said the offer was between 10 and
20 dlrs per share too low.
    <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr> has made no comment on the offer.
    Gabelli said he also proposes that management consider
spinning off all assets, other than the <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr> <acqbus>broadcast</acqbus>
properties, to shareholders. The licenses of the broadcast
properties have long been entangled in a series of challenges.
    "One thing is going to be clear and that is I'm going to
the meeting and putting up "no greenmail," Gabelli said.
    Gabelli said he fears that greenmail might be a motivation
in the offer.
    The annual meeting is to be held in Akron, Ohio.

<acqabr>GENCORP</acqabr> {<acqcode>GY</acqcode>} BIDDER PLANS SALE OF AEROSPACE UNIT
    WASHINGTON, March 18 - {<purchaser>General Partners</purchaser>}, controlled by
privately-held Wagner and Brown and by AFG Industries Inc, said
plans to sell <acquired>GenCorp Inc</acquired>'s <acqbus>aerospace and soft drink bottling</acqbus>
divisions if it succeeds in acquiring the company.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
<purchaser>General Partners</purchaser> said proceeds from the sale of <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr>'s
aerospace division would help it repay some of the debt it
would incur in the 100 dlr a share cash tender offer.
    <purchaser>General Partners</purchaser>, which launched the surprise tender offer
today, said it already 2,180,608 shares of <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr>, or 9.4 pct
of the total outstanding common stock.
    <purchaser>General Partners</purchaser>, which estimated the total cost of the
takeover at <dlramt>2.5 billion dlrs</dlramt>, also said it plans to continue
<acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr>'s policy of trying to settle Federal Communications
Commission charges against two of its television and 12 radio
station licenses.
    It said it would also continue <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr>'s policy of trying
to sell its New York-area television station WOR to MCA Inc
{MCA} for 387 mln dlrs and its Los Angeles station KHJ to Walt
Disney Co {DIS} for 217 mln dlrs.
    But <purchaser>General Partners</purchaser> said it plans to keep <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr>'s
headquarter in <acqloc>Akron, Ohio</acqloc>.
    <purchaser>General Partners</purchaser> also said it would maintain <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr>'s
plastics and industrial products division as well as tires and
related products.
    But it left open that it might make other changes in
<acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr>'s operations after it completes the merger.
    Besides using 250 mln dlrs of its own equity for the tender
offer, <purchaser>General Partners</purchaser> said it would seek one billion dlrs
under a secured margin facility from Wells Fargo Bank N.A.
and other banks. It also said it would seek 1.25 billion dlrs
from the sale to Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc or its
affiliates of senior subordinated promissory notes.
    In a March 18 letter to <acqabr>GenCorp</acqabr> Chairman William Reynolds,
which was included in the SEC filing, <purchaser>General Partners</purchaser>
officials said they were "confident of our ability to promptly
obtain the remaining funding as described in our offer
materials."
    "For this reason, we do not forsee any obstacles to a
prompt consummation of the transaction," <purchaser>General Partners</purchaser> said.
    Shearson is dealer manager of the <purchaser>General Partners</purchaser> offer

    It said a spermicide used in <sellerabr>INKEY</sellerabr>'s condoms contains an
ingredient that may help prevent the sexual transmission of
AIDS. The ingredient was cited in an article in the West German
publication, Aids Forschung. But it said the article was
about the ingredient and did not mention the spermicide or the
condoms made by <sellerabr>INKEY</sellerabr>.
    The company also said it is changing its name to
Eurocapital Corp shortly.
    <purchabr>Solar Systems</purchabr> said it was buying the 45 pct stake in a

the remaining shares of the company, which was set up to
distribute <acqbus>condoms and vaginal products</acqbus> that are made, or are
being developed by <sellerabr>INKEY</sellerabr>.
    The agreement calls for a <dlramt>two mln dlr</dlramt> payment to Inkey for
the distributorship. The first 500,000 dlr payment is due 30
days after the products are approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. It said <acqabr>Europharmaceutical</acqabr> plans to soon file
with the FDA to market the condom, but expects the approval
process to be a lengthy one.
    The company said the active ingredient in the spermicide is
currently used in the U.S. in antiseptic applications unrelated
to condoms. As far as it knows, the ingredient has not been
tested in a spermicide.
    <sellerabr>Inkey</sellerabr>'s condoms will be sold in the U.S. under the brand
name, "Carlton." The exclusive distribution contract for the
products runs for three years and is renewable for one-year
periods, the company said.
    It said the condoms are currently sold in Spain but have
not gone on sale in other European countries.
    It said <acqabr>Europharmaceutical</acqabr> currently does not have the
resources to make the payments under the distribution agreement
or fund the studies necessary to obtain marketing approval from

ANALYSTS SEE NO OTHER BIDDER FOR <acqabr>PUROLATOR</acqabr>{<acqcode>PCC</acqcode>}
    New York, March 2 - Several analysts said they do not

<acquired>Purolator Courier Corp</acquired> by <purchaser>E.F. Hutton LBO Inc</purchaser> and a management
group from <acqabr>Purolator</acqabr>'s courier division.
    There had been speculation another offer might be
forthcoming, but analysts mostly believe the 35 dlrs per share
price being paid by <purchabr>Hutton</purchabr> and the managers' PC Acquisition Inc
is fully valued.
    Analysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubted
another bidder would emerge since <acqabr>Purolator</acqabr> had been for sale
for sometime before a deal was struck with <purchabr>Hutton</purchabr> Friday.
    <acqabr>Purolator</acqabr>'s stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It
had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on
Friday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company
might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
    analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive
offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for
sometime before the deal with <purchabr>Hutton</purchabr> was struck Friday.
    <purchabr>Hutton</purchabr> had been in talks with <acqabr>Purolator</acqabr>'s adviser, Dillon,
Read and Co since late December, a <purchabr>Hutton</purchabr> spokesman said.
    <purchabr>Hutton</purchabr> is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the
shares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive
29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock in
a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the <acqabr>Purolator</acqabr> U.S.
courier operation. <purchabr>Hutton</purchabr> values the warrants at two to three
dlrs per share.
    Wall Street sources also said today that a rival bidder
might be discouraged by a breakup fee Purolator would have to
pay if it ends its agreement with <purchabr>Hutton</purchabr>. The sources would not
reveal the amount of the fee, which will be noted in documents

<purchabr>DART</purchabr> GROUP FLEXIBLE ON <acqabr>SUPERMARKETS</acqabr> {<acqcode>SGL</acqcode>} BID
    NEW YORK, March 22 - {<purchaser>Dart Group Corp</purchaser>} said it told
<acquired>Supermarkets General Corp</acquired> {<acqcode>SGL</acqcode>} it was flexible on the price it
would pay to acquire the company.
    <purchabr>Dart</purchabr> has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each <acqabr>SGL</acqabr>
share if the <acqabr>SGL</acqabr> board recommended the offer to shareholders.
    <acqabr>SGL</acqabr> has termed the <dlramt>1.62 billion dlr</dlramt> offer unsolicited.
    In a letter to <acqabr>SGL</acqabr> dated March 20, <purchabr>Dart</purchabr> also said it was
denied confidential information on <acqabr>SGL</acqabr> that would be given to
other potential bidders.
    <acqabr>SGL</acqabr> officials could not be reached for comment.
    <purchabr>Dart</purchabr> said it was advised that a selling brochure for the
sale of <acqabr>SGL</acqabr> had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers,
but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access to
<acqabr>SGL</acqabr>'s books and records and the opportunity to talk with key
employees.
    "We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyout
firms," said a source close to <purchabr>Dart</purchabr>. Analysts have said <acqabr>SGL</acqabr>
management may be considering a leveraged buyout.
    <purchabr>Dart</purchabr> said it remains interested in acquiring <acqabr>SGL</acqabr> on a
friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all
the terms of its offer.
    <purchabr>Dart</purchabr> said <acqabr>SGL</acqabr> representatives said the company has not
received any other offer.
    It said it requested the confidential information to better
understand <acqabr>SGL</acqabr>, but was denied this because it refused to sign
an agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for <acqabr>SGL</acqabr> without
<acqabr>SGL</acqabr>'s approval.
    The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy
<acqabr>SGL</acqabr> shares, <purchabr>Dart</purchabr> said. It considered those conditions
unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly
transaction, it said.
    <purchabr>Dart</purchabr> has just under five pct of <acqabr>SGL</acqabr> shares.
    <purchabr>Dart</purchabr> said it requested the information before its meeting
with <acqabr>SGL</acqabr> representatives, but held the meetings in the hope
representatives would reach an agreement.
    It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told
there were certain issues important to <acqabr>SGL</acqabr> management and while
they were not conditions to the deal, <purchabr>Dart</purchabr> was expected to take
them into account in putting together its package.
    It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln
dlrs to <acqabr>SGL</acqabr> chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vice
president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine.
    <purchabr>Dart</purchabr> said this payment was intended for the three officers'
severance agreements, although there was an implication that
Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their
own volition.
    <purchabr>Dart</purchabr> said under their present agreements, none of these
officers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also,
<purchabr>Dart</purchabr> said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6
mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management's
incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost
of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares
unless waived by the company's compensation committee.
    <purchabr>Dart</purchabr> said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top
management's supplemental retirement plan.
    <purchabr>Dart</purchabr> said another issue was to agree to future severance
obligations and future salary guarantees for top management,
estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations
under the company's present policy.
    <purchabr>Dart</purchabr> said despite such management payments, it agreed to
discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to
negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with <acqabr>SGL</acqabr>.
    <acqabr>Supermarkets General</acqabr> owns the Path Mark <acqbus>supermarket</acqbus> chain
and Rickels home centres.
    <purchabr>Dart</purchabr> also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed
by an <acqabr>SGL</acqabr> shareholder, seeking to stop <acqabr>SGL</acqabr> from taking such
actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence.
    The suit also sought to have directors carry out their
fiduciary duty.
    Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an
unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of
securities to shareholders which make a takeover more
expensive.

<purchabr>NIPPON LIFE</purchabr>, <acqabr>SHEARSON</acqabr> TIE-UP SEEN SETTING TREND
    By Steven Brull, Reuters
    TOKYO, March 24 - <purchaser>Nippon Life Insurance Co</purchaser>'s <dlramt>538 mln dlr</dlramt>
purchase of a 13 pct stake in <acquired>Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc</acquired>
<acqbus>brokerage</acqbus> unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers
are likely to follow, securities analysts said.
    The investment in one of Wall Street's top <acqbus>brokerage</acqbus> houses
is likely to pay off in dollars and international market
position, they said. "It's part of a trend towards growing
capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign
financial institutions," said Simon Smithson, an analyst with
Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.
    The investment in <acqabr>Shearson Lehman</acqabr>, a growing firm described
by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail <acqbus>brokerage</acqbus>, will give
<purchabr>Nippon Life</purchabr> a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on
Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its
assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.
    <purchabr>Nippon Life</purchabr> staff will also acquire expertise in business
sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.
    The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50
joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset
management, market research, and consulting on financing.
    <purchabr>Nippon Life</purchabr> is Japan's largest insurance company and the
world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.
    The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the
deal in April, making <purchabr>Nippon Life</purchabr> the first Japanese life
insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.
    The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese
insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.
Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks
and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and
instruments.
    Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was
appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's
board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a
limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.
    Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and
problem-plagued banks in 1984. "But now Japanese are going for
blue-chip organisations," he said.
    "It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing
industries," said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. "With a
historically high yen, and historically low interest rates,
there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan."
    Competition in fund management has grown along with greater
Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln
yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17
to 18 pct, he said.
    To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and
gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to
spread to Japan with further deregulation. "The high regulatory
environment has delayed (life insurance firms')
diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products

<purchabr>NIPPON LIFE</purchabr>, <acqabr>SHEARSON</acqabr> TIE-UP SEEN SETTING TREND
    By Steven Brull, Reuters
    TOKYO, March 24 - <purchaser>Nippon Life Insurance Co</purchaser>'s <dlramt>538 mln dlr</dlramt>
purchase of a 13 pct stake in <acquired>Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc</acquired>
<acqbus>brokerage</acqbus> unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers
are likely to follow, securities analysts said.
    The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses
is likely to pay off in dollars and international market
position, they said. "It's part of a trend towards growing
capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign
financial institutions," said Simon Smithson, an analyst with
Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.
    The investment in <acqabr>Shearson Lehman</acqabr>, a growing firm described
by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail <acqbus>brokerage</acqbus>, will give
<purchabr>Nippon Life</purchabr> a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on
Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its
assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.
    <purchabr>Nippon Life</purchabr> staff will also acquire expertise in business
sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.
    The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50
joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset
management, market research, and consulting on financing.
    <purchabr>Nippon Life</purchabr> is Japan's largest insurance company and the
world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.
    The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the
deal in April, making <purchabr>Nippon Life</purchabr> the first Japanese life
insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.
    The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese
insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.
Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks
and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and
instruments.
    Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was
appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's
board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a
limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.
    Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and
problem-plagued banks in 1984. "But now Japanese are going for
blue-chip organisations," he said.
    "It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing
industries," said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. "With a
historically high yen, and historically low interest rates,
there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan."
    Competition in fund management has grown along with greater
Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln
yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17
to 18 pct, he said.
    To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and
gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to
spread to Japan with further deregulation. "The high regulatory
environment has delayed (life insurance firms')
diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products
in an environment of increasing competition for performance on
fund management," Smithson said.

    The transaction is expected to be completed by September

    <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr> said it expects no material gain or loss this year from

can be evaluated in full only when the definitive pacts are
completed, it said.
    The long-term effect of the transaction on <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr>'s earnings
should be positive, it added, as it will allow capital
expenditures to be cut back and will reduce corporate and
divisional overheads as well as operating expenses in the
European business.
    The sale is an important part of a restructuring announced
in November, <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr> said.
    Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt incurred
in the purchase of the Arnold Foods and Old London specialty
baking businesses and the stock repurchase program that was 
part of the restructuring.
    As of December 31, <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr> had bought about 15 mln of its
common shares, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in January, for a
total cost of 621.8 mln dlrs, according to its 1986 annual

    In December, <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr> acquired Arnold Foods and Old London for a
total of about 170 mln dlrs.
    <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr> had previously said it wanted to sell the European corn
wet milling business and use the proceeds to help reduce debt,
including that incurred under the share buyback.
    In total, <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr> has bought back about 16 mln shares of common
stock, adjusted for the split, it said today. In November it
authorized a buyback of 20 mln shares, adjusted for the split.
    The buyback and the restructuring were triggered in
November, after companies controlled by Ronald Perelman,
chairman of Revlon Group Inc {REV}, acquired about 7.6 pct of
CPC's then outstanding stock.
    In 1986, the <acquired>European corn wet milling business</acquired> had sales

FERRUZZI DEAL WITH <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr> WORTH <dlramt>630 MLN DLRS</dlramt>
    BRUSSELS, March 25 - The Ferruzzi Group's holding company
<purchaser>Agricola Finanziara SpA</purchaser> will pay <dlramt>630 mln dlrs</dlramt> for the <acquired>European
corn wet milling business</acquired> of <seller>CPC International Inc</seller> under the
<status>agreement reached in principle</status> between the two companies, a
statement by Ferruzzi released by its Brussels office said.
    When <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr> announced the agreement yesterday in New York, it
said only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs.
    Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several
clauses of the contract and needs government authorisations.
    It said the deal would involve 13 starch factories
employing about 5,000 people in eight European Community
countries plus facilities and commercial operations in other EC
states.
    The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of
1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year, or
about one third of EC production, from about 2.7 mln tonnes of
cereals.
    Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend
its presence in the European agro-industrial industry both
geographically and in terms of products.
    It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugar
and of soya oil and cake, and the major cereal trader.
    It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximum
quotas, of which <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr> currently holds a 25 pct share, and said
it foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch in
the future, notably in the production of ethanol for fuel.
    Raul Gardini, president of the Ferruzzi Group, said the
present management of the <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr> milling business will be asked to
remain in their posts.

<purchabr>BP</purchabr> TO OFFER <dlramt>7.4 BILLION DLRS</dlramt> FOR <acqabr>STANDARD</acqabr> SHARES
    LONDON, March 26 - <purchaser>British Petroleum Co Plc</purchaser> {<purchcode>BP.L</purchcode>} said it
<status>intended to make a tender offer</status> for the 45 pct of <acquired>Standard Oil
Co</acquired> {<acqabr>SRD.N}</acqabr> it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, for
a total of <dlramt>7.4 billion</dlramt> if the offer is fully accepted.
    The offer would be made through its {BP North America Inc}
unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. The
offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares
being tendered.
    <purchabr>BP</purchabr> said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based
on its own valuation as well as those of its financial
advisers. It took into account reviews of both public and
non-public information.
    <acqabr>Standard</acqabr> closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down
1-3/4 dlrs.
    <purchabr>BP</purchabr> shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at
last night's close.
    About a third of the cash payable would be met from <purchabr>BP</purchabr>'s
own resources.
    The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly from
banks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and
partly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. The
company said it was in the course of arranging these
facilities.
    <purchabr>BP</purchabr> Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group's
investment in <acqabr>Standard</acqabr> was its largest single asset. Full
ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be
made without the limitations of a minority interest.
    <purchabr>BP</purchabr> also believed the acquisition represented the optimum
use of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices
were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the
investment.
    Walters added that it also felt that, due to management
changes in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even
in a lower oil price environment.
    <acqabr>Standard</acqabr>'s net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs
and in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before
tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.
    Analysts said that the move by <purchabr>BP</purchabr> had come as a surprise.
One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group
should spend so much money buying a company it already
controlled.
    <purchabr>BP</purchabr> could also have bought up the remainder of <acqabr>Standard</acqabr>
shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.
    It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on
the U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended to
dispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the
1987/88 financial year, analysts said.
    Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted
that any effect on the government sale of its stake in <purchabr>BP</purchabr> would
depend on the reaction of the markets.
    The deal would probably push <purchabr>BP</purchabr>'s gearing up to around 59
pct from 20 pct currently, he said.
    However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not
repeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for <acqabr>Standard</acqabr>
returning to profitability this year -- and <purchabr>BP</purchabr> benefitting from
its cash flow -- were good.
    <acqabr>Standard</acqabr> was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.
    Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to
make money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from
production and its downstream activities would push it
comfortably into surplus.
    <purchabr>BP</purchabr> initially took a stake in <acqabr>Standard</acqabr> following the
discovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. <purchabr>BP</purchabr> had
inadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While <acqabr>Standard</acqabr>,
which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude
oil.
    The analysts said that <purchaser>BP</purchaser> had promoted a major management
reorganisation of <acqabr>Standard</acqabr> in the past year.
    The probability that much of the shake-up at <acqabr>Standard</acqabr> was
now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the
tender offer, Spedding said.
    <purchabr>BP</purchabr>'s willingness to take hard decisions such as major
balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well
received in the markets.
    The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially
after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division
-- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come
straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by
other sectors.

    He was quoted by the Irish magazine Business and Finance as

he had the support of two international banks if he decided
such a purchase might be worthwhile.
    In the magazine article, he suggested that if <acqbus>brewing</acqbus>
profits were calculated to be in the region of 80 mln punts,
the asking price would not be higher than 800 mln punts.
    "A multiple of ten times earnings would be the top whack for

said.
