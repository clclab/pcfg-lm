  <p>Contains two implementations of finite state machines. One is <code>DFSA</code>, which is older and used in some of
  the old parse code. The second is TransducerGraph, which represents a transducer (a generalization of a FSM) and is
  used in the newer grammar compaction code currently used in the parser.</p>
